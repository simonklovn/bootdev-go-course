## boot.dev -  Learn go
This project contains all exercises from the [boot.dev](http://boot.dev) online Go programming course [Learn go](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend). The goal of finishing this project was to maintain and strengthen the Go programming skills acquired in the course [TTK4145 Real-Time Programming](https://github.com/TTK4145) at NTNU. 

All main functions are based on skeleton code, and the main test programs were fully supplied by the course.Some exercises are left out due to their trivial nature.
