## boot.dev -  Learn go
This project contains 94 completed coding exercises from the [boot.dev](http://boot.dev) online Go programming course [Learn go](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend). 

In the course [TTK4145 Real-Time Programming](https://github.com/TTK4145) at NTNU, we spent 100+ hours on a comprehensive [term project](https://github.com/simonklovn/sanntid-heis) in which our language of choice was Go. We therefore had to dive head first into a new language, resulting in a steep learning curve and confusion along the way. The goal of finishing this online course was to maintain and strengthen the Go programming skills acquired, leaving me a better understanding of the most important syntax and mechanisms offered by Go. 

The main programs are based on skeleton code, and the main test programs were also supplied by the course. The first exercises from Chapter 1 and 2 (Introduction and Variables) are left out due to their trivial nature.
